This directory contains the source code for libmemcached that we will build and link to.

In future it may also contain source to memcached so we can be sure to have one available for running tests.

TO UPGRADE TO A NEW libmemcached RELEASE:

tar xvfz libmemcached-X.YY.tar.gz
rm -rf libmemcached
svn_load_dirs.pl -v https://perl-libmemcached.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src libmemcached libmemcached-X.YY
svn update
rm -rf libmemcached-X.YY
cd ..
make svnmanifest
