General:

add dual-var tests
test return from _append
remove memcached_server_list_append - deprecated
Resolve memory management: to DESTROY or not to DESTROY, that is the question!
    Given the relatively small number of objects involved
    we could use a hash (or pointer table) to track what's been freed already.


Makefile.PL:
    extract list of constants (#defined and enums)
        use those to write constant() sub for libmemcached.xs
        and list of exportable constants (which can be written to
        Memcached::libmemcached::Constants.pm and loaded by Memcached::libmemcached)

Structure:
    Clever typemap code should be able to default undef <foo>_length parameter values
        to the length of the corresponding <foo> argument.
    Aim to be at least thread-safe and ideally thread-hot.
    Make return type a dual-var like $! with integer and string message parts.

Tests:
    Need running memcached(s) to perform tests
    Write a t/launch.pm that starts N memcached servers on localhost
    and returns their access details (ie ports).
    Use launch.pm in test scripts.
