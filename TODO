General:

Resolve memory management: to DESTROY or not to DESTROY, that is the question!
    Use SV memory to hold structure
    To bless or not? Type safety (bless?, check size of scalar)
    memcached_clone usage and examples

Makefile.PL:
    parse memcached.h to extract MEMCACHED_SUCCESS etc
        then use ExtUtils::Constant to generate the code for constant()
        Also write list of constants to a file for including in EXPORT_OK & _TAGS

Structure:
    Clever typemap code should be able to default undef <foo>_length parameter values
        to the length of the corresponding <foo> argument.
    Aim to be at least thread-safe and ideally thread-hot.
    Make return type a dual-var like $! with integer and string message parts.
        add tests for it

Tests:
    Need running memcached(s) to perform some tests
    Write a t/launch.pm that starts N memcached servers on localhost
    and returns their access details (ie ports).
    Use launch.pm in test scripts.
    Remember that we're not trying to test libmemcached itself!
